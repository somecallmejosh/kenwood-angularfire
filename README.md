Web app for my drum instructor Kenwood Dennard. Utilizes the following features:

* Firebase/AngularFire BaaS
* AngularJS
* Bootstrap

I know it's uncommon to include `bower_components` and the `dist` directories in the repo. This project uses GitHub Pages, and these folders are needed in the `gh-pages` branch. One day I'll explore how to build this on the fly in the subtree.
